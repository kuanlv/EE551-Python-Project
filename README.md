# EE551-Python-Project
Proposal:
  My project proposal is to build a real estate application using Django framework and Postgres database. 
  Suppose there is a real estate company and the services of the application are provided by this company and both house sellers and house buyers will need these services. The company can post realtors on this application to recommend to customers. 

Functionality specification:
• Manage listings, realtors, contact inquiries and website users via admin
• Role based users (staff and non-staff)
• Display listings in app with pagination
•	Ability to set listings to unpublished
•	Search listings by keyword, city, state, bedrooms and price (Homepage & search page)
•	List realtors on about page with “seller of the month” (Control via admin)
•	Listing page should have a form to submit inquiry for that property listing
•	Form info should go to database and notify realtor(s) with an email
•	Frontend register/login to track inquiries
• etc...

An application must have a nice and clean user interface which will require lots of work spent on HTML and CSS, since there are many fancy html templates online so my main focus can be kept on back-end implementations and Python.
